# Animeccha
A project aiming to include my favorite montages across different animes such that a user can scroll and go backward and forward through the frames of that montage. Built with React, a bit of framer-motion and TypeScript. 

# Installation
yarn install

# Running
- Perform `node server.js` to run the static images server.
- Perform `yarn start` to run the frontend.
